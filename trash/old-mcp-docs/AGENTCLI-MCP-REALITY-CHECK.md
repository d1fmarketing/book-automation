# Reality Check: Agent CLI and MCP Tools

## The Truth About These Tools

After extensive testing across all major package managers, here's the reality:

### Installation Attempts and Results

#### NPM (Node Package Manager)
```bash
$ npm i -g @agentcli/agentcli @mcp/cli

npm ERR! code E404
npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@agentcli%2fagentcli - Not found
npm ERR! 404 '@agentcli/agentcli@*' is not in this registry.
```

#### PyPI (via pipx)
```bash
$ pipx install agentcli

Fatal error from pip prevented installation.
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement agentcli
ERROR: No matching distribution found for agentcli
```

#### Homebrew
```bash
$ brew install agentcli mcp-tool

Warning: No available formula with the name "agentcli".
Warning: No available formula with the name "mcp-tool".
```

## What This Means

1. **These tools don't exist** as publicly available software packages
2. **The script cannot be executed** as written because the tools can't be installed
3. **The architecture is conceptual** - it describes how the system would work IF these tools existed

## Why This Confusion?

The project documentation describes an idealized architecture using:
- **agentcli** - A hypothetical unified CLI for AI services
- **mcp** - A hypothetical Model Context Protocol for browser automation

This is common in system design where the architecture is defined before implementation.

## What Actually Works

### The Mock Pipeline
```bash
# The mock scripts in scripts/mock/ demonstrate the workflow
export PATH="/Users/d1f/Desktop/Ebooks/book-automation/scripts/mock:$PATH"
make pipeline
```

### Real Alternatives That Exist Today

Instead of waiting for agentcli/mcp, you can use:

1. **For AI Text Generation**
   - OpenAI Python SDK
   - Anthropic Python SDK
   - LangChain

2. **For Image Generation**
   - OpenAI DALL-E API
   - Replicate API
   - Midjourney API

3. **For PDF Generation**
   - Puppeteer
   - Pandoc
   - WeasyPrint

4. **For Visual QA**
   - Playwright
   - Selenium
   - Puppeteer

## The Bottom Line

The script you were given assumes tools that **don't exist**. To actually generate your ebook, you need to either:
1. Use the mock implementation (already created)
2. Build the tools yourself
3. Use existing alternatives

The architecture is sound, but the implementation requires real tools, not hypothetical ones.
