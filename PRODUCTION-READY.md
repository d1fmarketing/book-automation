# 🚀 EBOOK MONEY MACHINE AI v2.0 - Production Ready!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Environment Check with Rate Limits ✅
- **Script**: `scripts/check-env.js`
- Validates all API keys
- Tracks rate limits in `.env.runtime`
- Enforces 60s minimum between Perplexity calls
- Run: `npm run check-env`

### 2. Perplexity Cache 24h ✅
- **Module**: `agents/deep-research-cached.js`
- Caches research for 24 hours
- Exponential backoff on failures
- Fallback data if API fails
- Auto-cleanup of expired cache

### 3. Research Integration in Content ✅
- **Updated**: `scripts/generate-content.js`
- Cites 2+ research bullets per chapter
- Adds source links at chapter end
- Includes research summary in intro
- Real statistics: "$2.7B revenue", "400M users"

### 4. Compliance Checker ✅
- **Script**: `scripts/compliance-checker.js`
- Word blacklists by niche
- Auto-adds required disclaimers
- Age gate for adult content
- Generates compliance reports

### 5. CI Safety Nets ✅
- **Workflows**: `.github/workflows/`
- 3x retry logic with backoff
- Auto-creates GitHub issues on failure
- Compliance check before publish
- Rate limit awareness

## 🎯 Production Commands

```bash
# Pre-flight check
npm run check-env

# Test components
npm run money:test

# Dry run (no publish)
npm run money:dry-run

# PRODUCTION RUN
npm run money:start

# Manual compliance check
node scripts/compliance-checker.js build/ebooks money
```

## 📊 What's Working Now

### Real Research Data
```yaml
summary: "ChatGPT generated $2.7 billion in revenue, 75% of OpenAI's earnings"
bullets:
  - "400 million active users with 1 billion projected by 2025"
  - "92% of Fortune 500 companies use ChatGPT"
  - "122.58 million daily active users"
```

### Smart Caching
- Research cached for 24h = massive API savings
- Cache key: MD5 hash of topic
- Location: `context/cache/[hash].json`

### Compliance by Niche
- **Money**: No "get rich quick" claims
- **Crypto**: No "guaranteed returns"
- **Adult**: Age gate + content warnings

### Production Safety
- Rate limit tracking
- Exponential backoff
- Fallback content
- Auto issue creation
