# Evidence: Agent CLI and MCP Don't Exist

## Proof of Non-Existence

### 1. NPM Registry Search
```bash
# Direct registry API check
$ curl -s https://registry.npmjs.org/@agentcli%2Fagentcli | jq .
{
  "error": "Not found"
}

$ curl -s https://registry.npmjs.org/@mcp%2Fcli | jq .
{
  "error": "Not found"
}

# Search for any package with these names
$ npm search agentcli
No matches found for "agentcli"

$ npm search "mcp cli"
No matches found for "mcp cli"
```

### 2. PyPI (Python Package Index) Search
```bash
# Direct PyPI API check
$ curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/agentcli/json | jq .
{
  "message": "Not Found"
}

$ curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/mcp-tool/json | jq .
{
  "message": "Not Found"
}
```

### 3. Homebrew Formula Search
```bash
# Homebrew API check
$ brew search agentcli
==> Searching for similarly named formulae and casks...
Error: No formulae or casks found for "agentcli".

$ brew search mcp
==> Formulae
dmtcp    mcpp    rmcast    smckit
```

### 4. GitHub Search
```bash
# No official repositories exist for these tools
# Searching GitHub returns only this book-automation project
# which references them as conceptual tools
```

## Installation Failure Log

Here's exactly what happens when you try to run the provided script:

```bash
# Attempt 1: NPM
$ npm i -g @agentcli/agentcli @mcp/cli
npm ERR! code E404
npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@agentcli%2fagentcli
npm ERR! 404 '@agentcli/agentcli@*' is not in this registry.

# Attempt 2: pipx
$ pipx install agentcli
Fatal error from pip prevented installation.
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement agentcli
ERROR: No matching distribution found for agentcli

# Attempt 3: Direct pip
$ pip install agentcli mcp-tool
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement agentcli
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mcp-tool
```

## Verification Commands

You can verify this yourself:
```bash
# Check npm
npm view @agentcli/agentcli
npm view @mcp/cli

# Check PyPI
pip index versions agentcli
pip index versions mcp-tool

# Check Homebrew
brew info agentcli
brew info mcp-tool
```

All of these commands will fail with "not found" errors.

## Conclusion

The tools referenced in the script:
- ❌ Do not exist in npm
- ❌ Do not exist in PyPI
- ❌ Do not exist in Homebrew
- ❌ Cannot be installed by any standard method

They are conceptual/hypothetical tools that would need to be built from scratch to implement the described architecture.
