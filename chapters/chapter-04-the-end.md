# Chapter 4: The End

The final validation passed at 6:47 PM.

Sarah leaned back in her chair as the success message filled the screen. Every check had passed—typography, contrast, layout, print geometry. The tiny test book, all five pages of it, sat complete in the release directory.

"We did it," Marcus said, opening the PDF on his screen. The pages were perfectly formatted, professional despite their minimal content. The cover image gleamed with its AI-generated abstract geometry.

They paged through their creation together. Each chapter flowed naturally into the next, the narrative of their testing journey encoded in the very content of the test. It was meta in the most satisfying way.

Sarah ran her finger along the edge of her monitor, tracing the outline of their success. "This proves the pipeline works. Not just the individual pieces, but the whole system. The Agent CLI, the MCP validation, the infinite loop—everything."

"First test, first success," Marcus agreed.

Outside, the city lights were beginning to twinkle in the gathering dusk. Their test was complete, but Sarah knew this was just the beginning. Tomorrow, they would build real books.

Tonight, they had proven it was possible.
