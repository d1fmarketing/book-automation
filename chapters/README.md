# Chapters Directory

This directory contains your book chapters as Markdown files.

## File Format

Each chapter should follow this naming convention:

- `chapter-01-title.md`
- `chapter-02-another-title.md`

## Chapter Template

Use the `chapter-template.md` as a starting point for new chapters.

## Important Notes

- Keep chapters in sequential order
- Use frontmatter for metadata (word count, status, etc.)
- Images will be auto-generated from `![AI-IMAGE: description]()` tags
