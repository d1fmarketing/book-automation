# Ready for Real Agent CLI Execution 🚀

## ✅ Cleanup Complete

All placeholder files have been removed:
- ❌ `build/dist/ebook.pdf` - removed
- ❌ `build/dist/ebook.epub` - removed  
- ❌ `build/tmp/ebook.html` - removed
- ❌ `assets/images/cover.jpg` - removed
- ❌ `release/*` - cleaned

## 📁 Current State

- ✅ `outline.yaml` - 5-page test book specification
- ✅ `chapters/` - 4 test chapters (200 words each)
- ✅ `templates/pdf-standard.css` - Professional book styling
- ✅ `AGENT_CLI_TEXT_MODEL=claude-3-opus` - Environment variable set

## 🎯 Production Commands

Run these commands to generate real content:

```bash
# 1. Generate cover image via Ideogram ($0.08)
agentcli call ideogram \
    --md chapters/ \
    --palette emotion \
    --max-images 1 \
    --out assets/images/

# 2. Build PDF/EPUB/HTML
./scripts/agentcli-builder-wrapper.sh \
    --md chapters/ \
    --img assets/images/ \
    --css templates/pdf-standard.css \
    --out build/dist/

# 3. Run MCP visual QA loop
make qa

# 4. Check results
ls -la release/
```

## 🔍 Expected Results

After successful execution:
- `release/ebook.pdf` - ~5 page PDF with professional formatting
- `release/ebook.epub` - Valid EPUB file
- `qa/last_fail.json` - Should show all checks passed
- `qa/screens/` - Any screenshots from QA process

## 🎉 Pipeline Validation

Once these commands run without errors and produce the final files, the entire Agent CLI + MCP pipeline is validated:
- ✅ Agent CLI remote endpoints work
- ✅ Ideogram image generation works
- ✅ Builder produces valid outputs
- ✅ MCP browser automation catches visual issues
- ✅ Infinite QA loop adjusts until perfect

The test book about "Sarah and Marcus testing the pipeline" will prove the system works end-to-end! 💥
