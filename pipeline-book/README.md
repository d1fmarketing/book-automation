### Post-Project Analysis

After creating this ebook, we conducted a thorough analysis of the process. The following documents provide valuable insights:

- **[POST-MORTEM.md](docs/POST-MORTEM.md)** - Complete analysis of what worked, what failed, and why
- **[LESSONS-LEARNED.md](docs/LESSONS-LEARNED.md)** - Key insights and technical lessons from the project
- **[PIPELINE-VS-REALITY.md](docs/PIPELINE-VS-REALITY.md)** - Comparison between the ideal pipeline and what actually happened

### Key Findings
