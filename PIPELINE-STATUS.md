## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test the current pipeline end-to-end**:
   ```bash
   # Create outline
   node agents/planner.js --topic="AI for Business" --chapters=10
   
   # Generate content
   node agents/writer.js --outline="outlines/outline-ai-for-business.json"
   
   # Polish tone
   node agents/tone-polisher.js --book="chapters/ai-for-business"
   
   # Check facts
   node agents/fact-checker.js --book="chapters/ai-for-business"
   
   # Inject affiliates
   node agents/affiliate-injector.js --ebook-dir="chapters/ai-for-business"
   ```

2. **Integration with main pipeline**:
   - Update `scripts/automation-pipeline.js` to use new agents
   - Add agent calls to appropriate phases
   - Test with real topic generation

3. **Production readiness**:
   - Add real API keys (.env)
   - Configure Redis for caching
   - Set up Hostinger VPS credentials
   - Enable GitHub Actions
